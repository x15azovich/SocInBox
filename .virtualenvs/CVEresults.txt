CVE Number: CVE-2016-6515
CVE Description: The auth_password function in auth-passwd.c in sshd in OpenSSH before 7.3 does not limit password lengths for password authentication, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crypt CPU consumption) via a long string.
CVE Solutions: https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-6515
CVE Number: CVE-2016-6210
CVE Description: sshd in OpenSSH before 7.3, when SHA256 or SHA512 are used for user password hashing, uses BLOWFISH hashing on a static password when the username does not exist, which allows remote attackers to enumerate users by leveraging the timing difference between responses when a large password is provided.

CVE Number: CVE-2004-1653
CVE Description: The default configuration for OpenSSH enables AllowTcpForwarding, which could allow remote authenticated users to perform a port bounce, when configured with an anonymous access program such as AnonCVS.
CVE Solutions: https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2004-1653
CVE Number: CVE-2004-2760
CVE Description: sshd in OpenSSH 3.5p1, when PermitRootLogin is disabled, immediately closes the TCP connection after a root login attempt with the correct password, but leaves the connection open after an attempt with an incorrect password, which makes it easier for remote attackers to guess the password by observing the connection state, a different vulnerability than CVE-2003-0190.  NOTE: it could be argued that in most environments, this does not cross privilege boundaries without requiring leverage of a separate vulnerability.
CVE Solutions: https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2004-2760
CVE Number: CVE-2005-2666
CVE Description: SSH, as implemented in OpenSSH before 4.0 and possibly other implementations, stores hostnames, IP addresses, and keys in plaintext in the known_hosts file, which makes it easier for an attacker that has compromised an SSH user's account to generate a list of additional targets that are more likely to have the same password or key.
CVE Solutions: https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2005-2666
CVE Number: CVE-2001-1382
CVE Description: The "echo simulation" traffic analysis countermeasure in OpenSSH before 2.9.9p2 sends an additional echo packet after the password and carriage return is entered, which could allow remote attackers to determine that the countermeasure is being used.

CVE Number: CVE-2007-2768
CVE Description: OpenSSH, when using OPIE (One-Time Passwords in Everything) for PAM, allows remote attackers to determine the existence of certain user accounts, which displays a different response if the user account exists and is configured to use one-time passwords (OTP), a similar issue to CVE-2007-2243.
CVE Solutions: https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2007-2768
CVE Number: CVE-2016-1908
CVE Description: The client in OpenSSH before 7.2 mishandles failed cookie generation for untrusted X11 forwarding and relies on the local X11 server for access-control decisions, which allows remote X11 clients to trigger a fallback and obtain trusted X11 forwarding privileges by leveraging configuration issues on this X11 server, as demonstrated by lack of the SECURITY extension on this X11 server.
CVE Solutions: https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-1908
CVE Number: CVE-2016-3115
CVE Description: Multiple CRLF injection vulnerabilities in session.c in sshd in OpenSSH before 7.2p2 allow remote authenticated users to bypass intended shell-command restrictions via crafted X11 forwarding data, related to the (1) do_authenticated1 and (2) session_x11_req functions.

CVE Description: The (1) roaming_read and (2) roaming_write functions in roaming_common.c in the client in OpenSSH 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x before 7.1p2, when certain proxy and forward options are enabled, do not properly maintain connection file descriptors, which allows remote servers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact by requesting many forwardings.
CVE Solutions: https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-0778
CVE Number: CVE-2016-0777
CVE Description: The resend_bytes function in roaming_common.c in the client in OpenSSH 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x before 7.1p2 allows remote servers to obtain sensitive information from process memory by requesting transmission of an entire buffer, as demonstrated by reading a private key.
