IP Address,Vulnerability,Description
hackthissite.org,CVE-2013-2070,"http/modules/ngx_http_proxy_module.c in nginx 1.1.4 through 1.2.8 and 1.3.0 through 1.4.0, when proxy_pass is used with untrusted HTTP servers, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and obtain sensitive information from worker process memory via a crafted proxy response, a similar vulnerability to CVE-2013-2028."
hackthissite.org,CVE-2013-2028,"The ngx_http_parse_chunked function in http/ngx_http_parse.c in nginx 1.3.9 through 1.4.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and execute arbitrary code via a chunked Transfer-Encoding request with a large chunk size, which triggers an integer signedness error and a stack-based buffer overflow."
hackthissite.org,CVE-2011-4451,"** DISPUTED ** libs/Wakka.class.php in WikkaWiki 1.3.1 and 1.3.2, when the spam_logging option is enabled, allows remote attackers to write arbitrary PHP code to the spamlog_path file via the User-Agent HTTP header in an addcomment request.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue because the rendering of the spamlog_path file never uses the PHP interpreter."
hackthissite.org,CVE-2011-4449,"actions/files/files.php in WikkaWiki 1.3.1 and 1.3.2, when INTRANET_MODE is enabled, supports file uploads for file extensions that are typically absent from an Apache HTTP Server TypesConfig file, which makes it easier for remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code by placing this code in a file whose name has multiple extensions, as demonstrated by a (1) .mm or (2) .vpp file."
hackthissite.org,CVE-2011-4317,"The mod_proxy module in the Apache HTTP Server 1.3.x through 1.3.42, 2.0.x through 2.0.64, and 2.2.x through 2.2.21, when the Revision 1179239 patch is in place, does not properly interact with use of (1) RewriteRule and (2) ProxyPassMatch pattern matches for configuration of a reverse proxy, which allows remote attackers to send requests to intranet servers via a malformed URI containing an @ (at sign) character and a : (colon) character in invalid positions.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2011-3368."
hackthissite.org,CVE-2011-4140,"The CSRF protection mechanism in Django through 1.2.7 and 1.3.x through 1.3.1 does not properly handle web-server configurations supporting arbitrary HTTP Host headers, which allows remote attackers to trigger unauthenticated forged requests via vectors involving a DNS CNAME record and a web page containing JavaScript code."
hackthissite.org,CVE-2011-4139,"Django before 1.2.7 and 1.3.x before 1.3.1 uses a request's HTTP Host header to construct a full URL in certain circumstances, which allows remote attackers to conduct cache poisoning attacks via a crafted request."
hackthissite.org,CVE-2011-3368,"The mod_proxy module in the Apache HTTP Server 1.3.x through 1.3.42, 2.0.x through 2.0.64, and 2.2.x through 2.2.21 does not properly interact with use of (1) RewriteRule and (2) ProxyPassMatch pattern matches for configuration of a reverse proxy, which allows remote attackers to send requests to intranet servers via a malformed URI containing an initial @ (at sign) character."
hackthissite.org,CVE-2010-3574,"Unspecified vulnerability in the Networking component in Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 21, 5.0 Update 25, 1.4.2_27, and 1.3.1_28 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors.  NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the October 2010 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on claims from a reliable downstream vendor that HttpURLConnection does not properly check for the allowHttpTrace permission, which allows untrusted code to perform HTTP TRACE requests.

hackthissite.org,CVE-2004-0700,Format string vulnerability in the mod_proxy hook functions function in ssl_engine_log.c in mod_ssl before 2.8.19 for Apache before 1.3.31 may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary messages via format string specifiers in certain log messages for HTTPS that are handled by the ssl_log function.
hackthissite.org,CVE-2004-0492,"Heap-based buffer overflow in proxy_util.c for mod_proxy in Apache 1.3.25 to 1.3.31 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (process crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a negative Content-Length HTTP header field, which causes a large amount of data to be copied."
hackthissite.org,CVE-2003-1580,"The Apache HTTP Server 2.0.44, when DNS resolution is enabled for client IP addresses, uses a logging format that does not identify whether a dotted quad represents an unresolved IP address, which allows remote attackers to spoof IP addresses via crafted DNS responses containing numerical top-level domains, as demonstrated by a forged 123.123.123.123 domain name, related to an ""Inverse Lookup Log Corruption (ILLC)"" issue."
hackthissite.org,CVE-2002-2012,"Unknown vulnerability in Apache 1.3.19 running on HP Secure OS for Linux 1.0 allows remote attackers to cause ""unexpected results"" via an HTTP request."
